I start with a definition and a simple formula. For many, it is all you will need to form an opinion about this space. It's hard to fault the attempt at efficiency. We all do it.

When constructing our perception of the world, we look for data sets that we can feed through our experiences to make easy decisions. Even in the face of complex data sets, our tendency is to reconstruct the variables so they fit in a machine output that we are comfortable with and recognize.

Let's challenge this.

### Dialogue

This web space will take on the form of a dialogic. What is a [dialogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic "wikipedia") you ask? Simply put, it is an exploration of meaning through dialogue. It is NOT an attempt to find a solution. A solution may exist and may even be apparent, but answers come only as existential solutions if they come at all.

This doesn't mean I don't bring biases or opinions. I got opinions! Some of them are core to my identity and I will not budge. But the success of this dialogic will be measured by your uncertainty about my position. If I am not presenting the strongest of all sides, then YOU need to hold me accountable. Because ultimately, this space fails.

Much like most of our public discourse is failing.

This is partly why I started with a definition and a formula. I want to state my bias. So I can be held accountable. There is nothing untrue about what you see above. Hopefully, through empathetic discourse, we can see that any attempt to push ourselves through simple formulas will result in the following:

$error: unspecified variables. see details

...and I will also discuss music I'm listening to. Because I like music. And dancing together takes the edge off.
