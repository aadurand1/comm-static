## Still here?

We want simple data and definitions; it helps mitigate the burden of complex decision making while building our perception of the world. Most people will leave after parsing the info above. If we see possible complexity in the data, our tendency is to focus on the familiar variables so it all fits into neat little boxes that are comfortable to us.

Let's challenge this.

### Dialogue

This web space will take on the form of a dialogic. What is a [dialogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic "wikipedia") you ask? Simply put, it is an exploration of meaning through dialogue. It is NOT an attempt to hear all side and then form a compromise. A compromise may or may not exist; the solution may even be apparent. In the dialogic, answers come only as existential solutions, when they come at all.

This doesn't mean I don't bring biases or opinions. I got opinions! Some of them are core to my identity and I will likely not budge on them. The success of this dialogic will be measured by your uncertainty about my position. If I am not presenting the strongest of all perspectives, then YOU need to hold me accountable, because ultimately, this space fails.

In the same most of our public discourse is failing.

Part of the desire to construct a dialogue in this space was the consistent frustration I experience while looking for honest and valuable public discourse on the web. If our once trusted sources of information are not presenting an honest discussion, then I will just do it myself!

My main goal in starting with data and a definition is not to shame my readers into sticking around. Instead, I want to present myself clearly so I can be held accountable. There is nothing untrue about what you see listed above. My hope with this space is that through empathetic discourse, we can avoid attempts to filter others through simple formulas that very clearly result in errors.

### Harmony

...and I will also discuss music I'm listening to. Because I like music. And dancing together takes the edge off.
