When building our perception of the world, we look for simple definitions to ease the burden of our complex decisions. When we meet complexity in the data, our tendency is to redefine variables so that they fit into small boxes that are familiar and comfortable.

Let's challenge this.

#### Dialogue

This web space will take on the form of a dialogic. What is a [dialogic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogic "wikipedia") you ask? Simply put, it is an exploration of meaning through dialogue. It is NOT an attempt to report a solution. A solution may exist and may even be apparent, but answers come only as existential solutions when they come at all.

This doesn't mean I don't bring biases or opinions. I got opinions! Some of them are core to my identity and I will likely not budge. But the success of this dialogic will be measured by your uncertainty about my position. If I am not presenting the strongest of all sides, then YOU need to hold me accountable, because ultimately, this space fails.

Much like most of our public discourse is failing.

This is partly why I started with a definition and some. I want to state my bias, so I can be held accountable. There is nothing untrue about what you see above. Hopefully, through empathetic discourse, we can see that any attempt to push ourselves through simple formulas will result in an error.

#### Oh...

...and I will also discuss music I'm listening to. Because I like music. And dancing together takes the edge off.
